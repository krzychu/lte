# pylte - network scheduling simulator

This program is a python version of simulator used to obtain results published
in paper "Provable Fairness for TDMA Scheduling" by Marcin Bienkowski, Jaros≈Çaw
Byrka, Krzysztof Chrobak, Tomasz Jurdzinski and Dariusz Kowalski.

Original simulator is available at https://krzychu@bitbucket.org/krzychu/lte.git, 
but will no longer be developed.

## Installation
Make sure that following packages are installed:
* python 2.7 (python 3 not supported)
* numpy
* matplotlib

You need to clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/krzychu/pylte.git
```
And add `plyte/lib` to your PYTHONPATH:
```
PYHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/repository/lib
```

## Usage
### Running Existing Simulations
Let's assume that you want to run simulations published on INFOCOM conference. Go to
`simulations` directory and issue command:
```
python infocom_simulation.py
```
Program will create `infocom.sql` file. It contains sqlite3 database, and can be 
browsed using `sqlite3` command line utility. If execution terminates with error, delete
or rename previous `infocom.sql` file - simulator protects you from overwriting already
computed results.

In order to plot results you need to use another program from this directory:
```
python infocom_plot.py infocom.sql welfare
```
It will plot welfare for different algorithms over time. Run this program with no arguments
to see other plot options.
