# pylte - network scheduling simulator

This program is a python version of simulator used to obtain results published
in paper "Provable Fairness for TDMA Scheduling" by Marcin Bienkowski, Jaros≈Çaw
Byrka, Krzysztof Chrobak, Tomasz Jurdzinski and Dariusz Kowalski.

Original simulator is available at https://krzychu@bitbucket.org/krzychu/lte.git, 
but will no longer be developed.

## Installation
Make sure that following packages are installed:
* python 2.7 (python 3 not supported)
* numpy
* matplotlib

You need to clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/krzychu/pylte.git
```
And add `plyte/lib` to your PYTHONPATH:
```
PYHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/repository/lib
```

## Usage
### Running Existing Simulations
Let's assume that you want to run simulations published on INFOCOM conference. Go to
`simulations` directory and issue command:
```
python infocom_simulation.py
```
Program will create `infocom.sql` file. It contains sqlite3 database, and can be 
browsed using `sqlite3` command line utility. If execution terminates with error, delete
or rename previous `infocom.sql` file - simulator protects you from overwriting already
computed results.

In order to plot results you need to use another program from this directory:
```
python infocom_plot.py infocom.sql welfare
```
It will plot welfare for different algorithms over time. Run this program with no arguments
to see other plot options.

### Defining New Simulations
See `infocom_simulation.py` and `infocom_plot.py` for commented example.

## Internals
Simulator works in two stages: simulation and plotting. Simulation is computationaly expensive
so its results are saved to the database, for later processing and plotting.

### Data Flow
Settings of each simulation are stored in `lte.infrastructure.Simulation` object. Simulation
can be executed many times, each time producing a `lte.infrastructure.Execution` object
holding experiment results. Both sorts of objects are saved to the database, to
be later read by plotting tools.

### Main Loop
Main loop of the simulation can be found in `lib/lte/infrastructure.py`:
```python
def execute_once(sim, seed):
    channel = sim.channel(sim, **sim.channel_args)
    scheduler = sim.scheduler(sim, channel, **sim.scheduler_args)
   
    rate_history = []
    selection_history = []
    for t in xrange(sim.duration):
        rates = channel.next_rates()
        rate_history.append(rates)

        active_user = scheduler.get_active_user(rates)
        selection_history.append(active_user)

    rate_history = numpy.array(rate_history)
    selection_history = numpy.array(selection_history)

    return Execution(seed, rate_history, selection_history)
```

### Database
Database is a sqlite3 database, so python can access it using just standard library. It consists
of just two tables:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Simulation 
(
    num_users INTEGER, 
    duration INTEGER, 
    chanel TEXT,
    channel_args TEXT,
    scheduler TEXT,
    scheduler_args TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE Execution
(
    simulation_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    seed INTEGER,
    rate_history BLOB,
    selection_history BLOB,
    FOREIGN KEY(simulation_id) REFERENCES Simulation(ROWID) ON DELETE CASCADE 
);
```
`Simulation` holds general settings, while `Execution` contains results of
particular simulation execution. `rate_history` and `selection_history` are
base64 encoded numpy tables of sizes (duration, num\_users) and (duration, 1) 
respectively. Both tables have no explicitly defined primary key, but sqlite
provides special `ROWID` column which is utilized for this purpose. When defining
plots `simulation_id` is required and it's precisely `ROWID` from `Simulation` table.

Convenient database access is provided by `lte.infrastructure.SqlStorage` class.
